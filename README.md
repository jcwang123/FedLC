## Usage

### Dataset
In this paper, we perform the experiments using three imaging modalities, including the polyp images, fundus images, and prostate MR images. They could be downloaded from the public websites, or copied from [FedDG](https://github.com/liuquande/FedDG-ELCFS) and [PraNet](https://github.com/DengPingFan/PraNet).

### Pre-processing
After downloading the data resources, please run the file `utils/prepare_dataset.py`. Note that the file directory should be replaced with yours.

### Training 
TODO

### Testing
Please download the pre-trained weights from Baidu Disk (https://pan.baidu.com/s/10HkQ90xeFcHMaNgfIyT0iw, a1sm) and put them in the project directory.

Rename the directory as `logs/{dataset}/{exp_name}/model/`.

Run the test script `test.py`.

### Result
The test **IoU** scores and **ASSD** scores on the Polyp dataset are:
